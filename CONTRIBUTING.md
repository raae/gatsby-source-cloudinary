### Your Code Contribution

Here we guide you in submitting your code to Gatsby Source Cloudinary Plugin. If you follow these guidelines you will increase the chance of getting your code released.

If you are new to open source code contributions, here are some links to get you started:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.Github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.Github.com/en/Github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

Unsure where to begin? Read these ["good first issues"](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue").

#### Before You Start Contributing

- Add a comment to an exciting [issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues) to indicate your interest
- or create a new [issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/issues/new) to indicate what you'd like to contribute.

Ask a maintainer if your idea is within our plugin's scope before spending too much time on your solution.

#### Fork, Clone, and Install

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/fork)
2. Clone the fork to your local machine: `git clone /git@Github.com:<username>/gatsby-plugin-starter.git`
3. Move into the repository folder: `cd gatsby-plugin-starter`
4. Install packages: `yarn install`

##### A note on Yarn Workspaces

our plugin uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to host the plugin and demo code in one repository. The included demo will use the plugin code from the plugin workspace instead of the one published to the NPM registry so that you may manually test your changes while developing.

Makes sure to install an in the correct workspace by including `workspace plugin` or `workspace demo` in the command. Example: `yarn workspace plugin add lodash`.

> Be careful when publishing packages in a workspace. If you are preparing your next release and you decided to use a new dependency but forgot to declare it in the package.json file, your tests might still pass locally if another package already downloaded that dependency into the workspace root. However, it will be broken for consumers that pull it from a registry, since the dependency list is now incomplete so they have no way to download the new dependency. Currently, there is no way to throw a warning in this scenario.
> <cite>[Yarn Workspaces Docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)</cite>

#### Develop

Before starting to code:

- Create a branch for the issue you are working on: `git checkout -b <your branch name>`.

The core of you contribution will probably be to the plugin, but make sure to update the demo and add tests when it makes sense.

- Commit your changes regularly: `git commit -a -m <your message>`.

You'll find the plugin code in the `plugin` folder, and the demo code in the `demo` folder.

- Run the demo with `yarn develop`
- Run the tests in watch mode with `yarn watch`

Run both scripts from the root of your local repository folder.

#### Pull Request

Before making a Pull Request, make sure:

- All **tests run without failure** with `yarn test`.
- The **documentation is updated** to reflect your contribution.
- You have formatted the files correctly running `yarn format`.

After completing the above:

- Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/compare).
  - Select `base repository: cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary` > `base: main`
  - and `head repository: <your fork>` > `compare: <your branch>`
- Fill in the title and description following the **[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** standard.
  - If unsure, use a descriptive title, and a maintainer will help to make it follow the conventional commit standard.
- Do not worry about your individual commits, as they will be squashed into one commit with the Pull Request title and description as the commit message.

A maintainer will review your Pull Request in the style of [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/).

- If changes are requested, make those changes.

As soon as your Pull Request is merged, a new version of the plugin will be automatically [released](#release-process).

### Improving The Documentation

- "How to use the plugin" is documented in the [readme](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md).
- "How to contribute" is covered in this document you are reading now.

Improvements to both are very much encouraged.

You may follow the guide for [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution) or make changes directly from Github.

- [Edit the README.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/edit/main/README.md) directly on Github
- [Edit the CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-source-cloudinary/edit/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (this document) directly on Github
